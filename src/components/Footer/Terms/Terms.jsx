          <li>Customer reviews or ratings for Restaurants do not reflect the opinion of Tomato. Tomato receives multiple reviews or ratings for Restaurants by Customers, which reflect the opinions of the Customers. It is pertinent to state that each and every review posted on Tomato is the personal opinion of the Customer/reviewer only. Tomato is a neutral platform, which solely provides a means of communication between Customers/reviewers including Customers or restaurant owners/representatives with access to restaurant business page. The advertisements published on the Tomato Platform are independent of the reviews received by such advertisers.</li>
          <li>We are a neutral platform and we don't arbitrate disputes, however in case if someone writes a review that the restaurant does not consider to be true, the best option for the restaurant representative would be to contact the reviewer or post a public response in order to clear up any misunderstandings. If the Restaurant believes that any particular Customer's review violates any of the Tomato' policies, the restaurant may write to us at neutrality@Tomato.com and bring such violation to our attention. Tomato may remove the review in its sole discretion if review is in violation of the Terms, or content guidelines and policies or otherwise harmful to the Services</li>
